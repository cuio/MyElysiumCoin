Intro
---------------------

- Elysium is a P2P crypto-currency which is set to revolutionize the world by being the first Crypto-currency for Governments for Global Settlement Network and a Crypt-currency facilitating trade, commerce and investments worldwide through its disruptive technology completely decentralized without the need for a central server or trusted parties.

- Elysium word comes from Ancient greek Ἠλύσιον πεδίον , which is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time , it expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic, where they would remain after death, to live a blessed and happy life, and indulging in whatever employment they had enjoyed in life.

-In Homer’s Odyssey, Elysium is described as a paradise:

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be completely stable. Tags are created regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Elysium.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.

Setup
-----
You need the Qt4 run-time libraries to run Elysium-Qt.
